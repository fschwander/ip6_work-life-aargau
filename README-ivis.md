## Goals & Storytelling

The project was developed and embedded as a part of the IP6 project, which is released at the end of March 2020. The IP6 project uses Aargau's cantonal data to present itself in a meaningful way to people that are interested to learn about the area or, potentially, to seek for a job in the canton. Data are represented using different visualisation techniques such as video mapping, spatial visualisations, interaction patterns an others. 

The place to embed the ivis module into the Bachelor Thesis uses video sequences where interactive elements pop up, allowing user closer exploration. This can be accomplished by clicking on such an interactive point, which reveals more information along the side of the screen.

The canton of Aargau presents itself as one of the greatest in terms of connectivity to other major cities in Switzerland. This pull factor was used as a basis for this project.

One of the initial goals was to inspect whether the statement about the high connectivity can be confirmed. Thus, the visualisation contains a map of Switzerland where all major cities are displayed (Zürich, Aarau, Luganno, Bern...).
Switzerland is known as a country with one of the best train networks. Therefore, a train connections where considered as a main visualisation component. Data obtained from SBB were used for this purpose. When all data were collected
a design prototype was created. The concept allows user to select a city and analyse the connection to all the other places within the map. The canton of Aargau is highlighted to support user's orientation and 
the train connections sorted in an ascending order from the fastest to the slowest connection.

In the second iteration a car transportation was also considered as a matter of curiosity. If the train network is considered as flawless, how fast is it to go travel around by car? 
Data from Google Maps were obtained and added to the project. To allow users to compare the results easily, the visualisations are displayed next to each other. 
That enables visitors to see the two transportation types at a glance, and gives a quick overview of the results. Hence, the conclusion is that in 90% of the total cases, travelling by train wins over the car transportation.
Important is to note that trains are more reliable and rarely have delays. On contrary, cars are often stuck in traffic jams, but the visualisation considers that there are none and that the driver adheres to the traffic rules.

The conclusion: 
The canton of Aargau obtained its right to be presented as a canton with great connectivity to other cities in Switzerland. Aarau's worst position among 12 cities (if travelling by train) is 4th, which is only in two cases, in all other cases Aarau does even better.
The hypothesis has been confirmed, and the canton of Aargau gains its place as one of the best places in Switzerland to start off a journey!
