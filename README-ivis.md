## Goals & Storytelling

The project was developed and embedded as a part of the IP6 project, which is released at the end of March 2020. The IP6 project uses Aargau's cantonal data to present itself in a meaningful way to people that are willing to explore the area or, potentially, to seek for a job in the canton. Data are represented using different visualisation techniques such as video mapping, spatial visualisations, interaction patterns and others. 

The place in which should the ivis module be embedded uses video sequences where interactive elements pop up, allowing user closer exploration. This can be accomplished by clicking on such an interactive point, which reveals more information along the side of the screen.


The canton of Aargau presents itself as one of the greatest in terms of connectivity to other major cities in Switzerland. This pull factor was used as a basis for this project.

One of the initial goals was to inspect whether the statement about the high connectivity can be confirmed. Thus, the visualisation uses a map of Switzerland where all important cities are displayed (Zürich, Aarau, Luganno, Bern...). Switzerland is known as a country with one of the best train networks. Therefore, train connections were considered as the main visualisation component. Data obtained from SBB were used for this purpose. When all data were collected, a design prototype was created. The concept allows a user to select a city and see train connections to all other places on the map. The canton of Aargau is highlighted to support the user's orientation and the train connections are sorted in ascending order from the fastest to the slowest.

In the second iteration, car transportation was also considered as a matter of curiosity. If the train network is considered flawless, how fast is it to go travel around by car? Data from Google Maps were obtained and added to the project. To allow users to compare the results easily, the visualisations are displayed next to each other. That enables the visitors to see the two transportation types at a glance and gives a quick overview of the results. Hence, the conclusion is that in 90% of the total cases, traveling by train wins over car transportation. Important is to note that trains are more reliable and rarely have delays whereas cars are often stuck in traffic jams. However, the visualisation considers that there are none and that the driver adheres to the traffic rules.

Conclusion: The canton of Aargau obtained its right to be presented as a canton with great connectivity to other cities in Switzerland. Aarau's worst position among 12 cities (if traveling by train) is 4th, which is only in two cases, in all other cases, Aarau does even better. The hypothesis has been confirmed, and the canton of Aargau gains its place as one of the best places in Switzerland to start a journey!
