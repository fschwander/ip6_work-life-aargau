## Abstract

This bachelor thesis presents an exploratory user experience concept that allows users to get familiar with the canton of Aargau as a geographical region and highlights the local advantages of living and working. This user experience concept aims to emphasise positive aspects of the region, to provide contextual information about the place, while advertising local companies as an attractive job opportunity for professionals at the same time. Furthermore, the user experience concept should offer an entertaining experience that includes various exploratory elements such as visualisations, animations and video recordings of the region.

User experience evaluation revealed that test participants perceive the concept as visually appealing, funny and entertaining. The initial goals to present the advantages of the region and motivating people to visit a canton and to eventually apply for a job was therefore rated as successful. However, this application is not primarily intended to compete with conventional job platforms in terms of establishing business contacts between potential employees and companies.

The end product is a web application that is based on knowledge gained during a creative ideation phase, which was implemented while following an agile development process. This enabled to test various ideas in the early stages of the prototype and to continually adapt the concept based on healthy critique from potential target users.
