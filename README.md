## Technologies

Created with React, TypeScript and D3. 

## Goal

The goal is not to find out why people do not want to work in the canton of Aargau, the goal is to give people the possibility to explore the canton in a likable/entertaining way with the information that is available

## Research questions

- How relevant positive information about the canton of Aargau, such as affordable living costs, but also other lightly stated "fun aspects" can be used for economic promotion of the region through a visualisation that entertains end-user and eventually motivates him/her to seek for a job in  the canton of Aargau?
- What information visualisation techniques can be used in order to achieve the above statement and potentially, to lead to decent user's enjoyment experience deriving from testing results?
